# Kanban Task Management

This repository contains an implementation of the web application from
the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) - [Kanban task management web app](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/kanban-task-management-web-app-wgQLt-HlbB)
which is one of the more complex apps over there.

## Implementation Preparation

Over a period of next few months I would like to build the project from the ground up, whilst keeping some 
common engineering practices. The output should be a reference project which I would like to use on a daily basis 
(who doesn't love a great Task Manager), but also for sharing with others.

## The tech stack

At this point, the raw idea of the stack is following:

### UI Library

The frontend part of the app will be available in the [web-client](./web-client) directory.
